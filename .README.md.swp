It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl You are not allowed to use global variables No more than 5 functions per file In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t forget to push your header file All your header files should be include guarded Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project GitHub There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.  #Requirements  Expletive: printf("%F", anything); Output: FUCK  Integer: printf("%i", 5); Output: 5  String: printf("%s", This is a string.); Output: This is a string.  Character: printf("%c", A); Output:: A  #Examples  F - expletive  p - pointer  u - unsigned  o - octal  b - binary  X - Uppercase hex  Xl - Lowercase hex  % - Percent sign  i - integer  d - Integer in decimal  R - String in rot13  r - String in reverse  s - String  c - Single character  TYPE - OUTPUT  #Supported Format Types  Our team chose to add %x ,%X, %b, %o, %u, %r, %R, and %p formatting. We relied on the library we have been building at Alx as well as new concepts gathered during this project.  #Format Specifiers  Rebuild of the standard printf function in C. Our project required a function capable of printing with the %d, %c, %s, and %% specifiers to standard output. printf returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte at the end of strings). We were not asked to handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length.  #Welcome  A simple printf function built by Hope Gideon Hope and Edidiong Effiong for Alx software Engineering School.  #printf # printf
